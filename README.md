# 📊 Statistical Data Analysis

## 📖 Project Description

This project involves conducting a statistical analysis of a selected dataset (from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/krzysztofjamroz/apartment-prices-in-poland/data) and presenting the results in a report. The goal was to apply statistical methods in practice, including regression analysis, statistical tests, and data visualization.

The main outcome of the project is a PDF report containing a detailed analysis of the data, visualizations, and interpretation of the results. The report also includes code snippets used for the analysis, allowing for full reproducibility of the results.

## 🛠 Requirements

To run the project code (if you want to perform the analysis yourself), you need a Python environment and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy seaborn
```

## 🚀 Running the Project

1. Ensure you have Python installed (recommended version 3.x).
2. Download the project source code.
3. Run the appropriate script:

```bash
python load_data.py     # Loading data into the database
python analize_data.py  # Statistical analysis
```

Alternatively, you can review the PDF report, which contains all the code and analysis results.
